Customer Churn Analysis – Executive Summary

This project explores customer churn behavior and identifies the key factors influencing whether a customer stays or leaves. The analysis covers demographic attributes, account information, service usage patterns, contract duration, payment methods, and customer tenure. The objective is to highlight churn-driving factors and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

 Key Insights & Findings
1. Contract Type & Churn Behavior

Contract type plays the most significant role in customer churn:

Contract Type	Churn Rate
Month-to-Month	42%
One-Year	11%
Two-Year	3%

Interpretation:
Customers on short-term, month-to-month contracts are much more likely to churn. Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn because they build customer commitment and reduce switching opportunities.

2. Payment Method Impact

Payment method is another major churn driver.

Payment Method	Churn Rate
Electronic Check	45%
Credit Card	15%–18%
Bank Transfer	15%–18%
Mailed Check	15%–18%

Interpretation:
Electronic check customers churn almost 3× more than customers using secure digital payment options.
This may indicate:

Trust issues

Failed payments

Poor user experience

Encouraging transitions to stable payment methods can reduce churn.

3. Tenure-Based Churn

Customer tenure has a clear inverse relationship with churn.

Tenure Period	Churn Rate
< 1 year	50%
1–3 years	35%
> 3 years	15%

Interpretation:
The first year is the most critical phase. Customers who are dissatisfied early tend not to stay long.
Building strong onboarding and early engagement programs is essential.

4. Internet Service Type

Different internet services show different churn tendencies.

Internet Service	Churn Rate
Fiber Optic	30%
DSL	20%

Interpretation:
Fiber optic users churn more, likely due to:

Competition

High pricing

Speed vs expectations gap

This segment requires improved customer satisfaction efforts.

5. Demographics – Senior Citizens
Age Group	Churn Rate
Senior Citizens (65+)	41%
Non-Senior Customers	26%

Interpretation:
Senior citizens show significantly higher churn, possibly due to:

Difficulty with technology

Billing complexities

Service usage issues

Providing targeted support may improve retention.
